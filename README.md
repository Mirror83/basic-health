# Basic Health

The site is hosted on [Vercel](vercel.com/) at https://basic-health.vercel.app/ with the database hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech/)

The frontend, backend and API are implemented in NextJS (using the App Router).

## Setup

After cloning the project:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a `.env` file
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. The project is setup to use PostgreSQL, therefore the example DATABASE_URL value
   is a PostgreSQL database url.
   To work on this locally, if you have Postgres installed, you can setup the DB as follows
   using psql.

   ```bash
   psql -U postgres  # You can change "postgres" to your appropriate username
   CREATE DATABASE "basic-health"; # In psql
   $ exit; # In psql
   pnpm db:push  # To run the setup the schema
   pnpm db:seed  # To populate the db with some initial values
   ```

   You can also use a remote Postgres service like [Neon](https://neon.tech/) (It has a forgiving free tier), and use the URL generated by said service instead. Then run the schema-setup and seed steps as above.

4. Run the project
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
